# My Contributions to PitchTek - SPRING of 2024
## By Ethan Carroll

### NOTE: My IDE started pushing from my casual GitHub account and not my professional one. I could not figure out how to change it back. Therefor, some of my commits come from <ins>ethancarrollUNR</ins> and half come from <ins>chunkyshrapnel

### <ins>Work Completed on 1/29/2024
1. Reconfigured Git to make commits from the correct account
