2. I cleaned the data and outlined furhter steps to make the data perfect for our project. This can be seen in the <ins>backend\modify_data.py</ins> file.

3. I experimented with several differient ML models to try and get a prototype for our algorithm. This includes an MLP model and a Decision Tree model. This work can be seen in the <ins>backend\model.py</ins> file and the <ins>backend\modify_data.py</ins>
