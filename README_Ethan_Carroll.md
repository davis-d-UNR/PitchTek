1. I made a breakdown of data variables by usefulness. The Excel doc can be seen in the screenshot below or at the following link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YPk4Ht_ik9Fv__ZcWwB1SbodhqzvTOse7eczARbWEdk/edit#gid=0

2. I cleaned the data and outlined further steps to make the data perfect for our project. This can be seen in the <ins>backend\modify_data.py</ins> file.

3. I experimented with several different ML models to try and get a prototype for our algorithm. This includes an MLP model and a Decision Tree model. This work can be seen in the <ins>backend\model.py</ins> file.
